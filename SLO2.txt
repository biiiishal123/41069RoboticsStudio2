Conveyor Palletizing Cobot

A cost-effective Robotic palletiser system designed to automate the pick, pack, and stack of coffee pouches of different shapes and dimensions into the palletiser, equipped with TM5 and TM12, conveyer system, and sensors for easy to operate with safety. 


Functional Requirements:
S.NO	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS	DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE	Functionality
1	Cobots should be able to pick up the coffee pouch from moving conveyer	5	Pick and pack
2	Cobots should be able place the coffee pouch inside the packing box without fail	5	Pick and pack
3	Cobots should be able to stack the coffee box with provided stacking pattern for space optimization	4	Stack
4	Safety parameters should be placed around the cobots of at least 2m 	5	Safety
5	A safety manual stop button to be placed in conveyer for protecting from physical hazard	4	Safety
6	Box design to ensure compatibility with the effective gripper and to allow for effective stacking onto the pallet	4	Efficiency
7	Cobots should be able to communicate with each other and place their movement coordinates avoiding collision	3	Efficiency

Design Parameters:
S.NO	DESIGN PARAMETERS	DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE	Functionality
1	It should determine the placement of the coffee pouch and pick it up without fail (Accuracy up to 99%) (9 out of 10) picking	5	Accuracy
2	First cobots should be able to pick coffee pouch of 250 gram and second cobots should be able to pick coffee box of 2 kg 	4	Gripping mechanism
3	Cobots should be able to pick 12 packs per minute for 250 gram and 6 packs per minute for 1 kg of bag	4	Speed
4	Cobots should be able to slow down itâ€™s movement when workers come inside safety parameters	5	Safety
5	Cobots should travel through shortest distance from picking the pouch to placing to box for optimizing the time 	3	Speed
6	Cobots should reach up to the distance of 1.5 meter from the base line and able to stack the box up to the height of 1.2m  	3	Stack optimization 
7	Cobots should be able to stack each coffee box with 2cm away from previous coffee box with 85% accuracy	4	Accuracy
